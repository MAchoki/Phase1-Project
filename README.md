# Phase1-Project

# Aviation Safety Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to enhance aviation safety by analyzing historical aviation accident data. Through detailed data exploration and analysis, we uncover key patterns and insights that can inform safety improvements and risk mitigation strategies.

## Business Understanding
### Stakeholders
- Aviation Safety Authorities
- Airlines and Aircraft Manufacturers
- Policy Makers and Regulators

### Key Business Questions
1. What are the most common factors contributing to aviation accidents?
2. How do weather conditions impact the severity of aviation incidents?
3. Which phases of flight are most prone to severe accidents?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
### Source of Data
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and includes detailed records of aviation accidents and incidents.

### Description of Data
The dataset comprises various fields, including event details, location, aircraft information, weather conditions, and injury severity. Key columns include `Event.Date`, `Location`, `Aircraft.damage`, `Weather.Condition`, and `Total.Fatal.Injuries`.

### Visualizations
1. **Injury Severity Distribution**: Shows the range and frequency of injury severities across incidents.
2. **Weather Condition vs. Total Fatal Injuries**: Illustrates the relationship between weather conditions and the number of fatal injuries.
3. **Aircraft Damage vs. Broad Phase of Flight**: Highlights which phases of flight are associated with significant aircraft damage.

## Conclusion
### Summary of Conclusions
1. **Common Factors**: Landing and takeoff phases are most prone to severe accidents, indicating critical periods for safety interventions.
2. **Weather Impact**: Incidents under Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) tend to have higher fatal injuries, underscoring the need for better instrumentation and pilot training.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Fluctuations in incident frequency over the years highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and improvement in aviation safety protocols.

These findings provide actionable insights for improving aviation safety measures and mitigating risks associated with aviation operations.
